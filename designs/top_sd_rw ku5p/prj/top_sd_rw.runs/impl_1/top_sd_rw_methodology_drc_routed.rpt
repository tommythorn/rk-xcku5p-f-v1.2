CLKC-22#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with ZHOLD does not drive sequential IO  
The MMCME4 cell u_clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has COMPENSATION value ZHOLD, but CLKOUT0 output does not drive any sequential IO cells. It is recommended to use the MMCM without a feedback buffer and set COMPENSATION to INTERNAL.
